Another junior year group design project. Though not a part of the team i volunteered for implementation of the idea by assembling the microcontroller and the electronics and writing the simple code for the control system and the sensors.

Thanks to Sabyasachi Roy, Swarna Sarkar and Safwan Kabir Raihan for letting me contribute.
